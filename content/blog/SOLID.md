SOLID is an acronym for five core principles of software development. These principles are considered to be the foundation for creating maintainable and extensible applications. The acronym stands for:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one and only one responsibility. This means that each class should be responsible for a single part of the application, and that responsibilities should not be combined.

## Open-Closed Principle

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that classes should be designed in such a way that they can be extended without having to modify their existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. This means that subclasses should always be able to substitute for their parent classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This means that interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. This means that classes should depend on abstractions and not on concrete implementations.

By following these principles, developers can create applications that are extensible, maintainable, and testable. Additionally, code written using these principles will be more readable and understandable, making it easier for other developers to work with.
